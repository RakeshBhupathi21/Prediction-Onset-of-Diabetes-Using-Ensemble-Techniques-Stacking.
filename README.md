# Prediction-Onset-of-Diabetes-Using-Ensemble-Techniques-Stacking.
**Overview**

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on predicting the onset of diabetes using ensemble techniques, with a specific emphasis on the stacking method. Diabetes is a widespread and serious health issue, and accurate prediction models can contribute to early detection and intervention.

**Project Description**

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes. Ensemble techniques, particularly stacking, are employed to combine the strengths of multiple base models, enhancing overall predictive performance.

**Key Features**

**Ensemble Techniques:** Utilizes a combination of machine learning models, including decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic regression, to create a powerful ensemble through stacking.

**Data Preprocessing: **Implements comprehensive data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, scale features, and ensure the input data is suitable for model training.

**Model Evaluation:** Utilizes various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the effectiveness of the ensemble model.
